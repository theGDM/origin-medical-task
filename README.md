## **Tools Used :**
**`FrontEnd:`** To make the UI of the web application, I have used the **React.js** and **Material UI** library.

**`BackEnd:`** Backend is made using the **Node.js**.

**`Cloud-Computing:`** I have used AWS, for storing the uploaded images, creating the tables, creation of REST Apis, hosting of the application and for the backend code deployment.

**`Database:`** For storing the Uplaoded images I have used the **S3 Bucket**, and **DynamoDB** for maintaining the tables images, users, and labels data.

**`Deployment:`** Currently the web application hosted on **AWS Amplify** and **Github**.

**`Error-Logging:`** I have used **Google cloud** for printing the application logs.
